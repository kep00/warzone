a war game greated based on c++
Project Title: Advanced Program Design with C++ - Risk Computer Game
Description:

Objective: Developed a simplified version of the “Risk” computer game as part of the COMP 345 course at Concordia University, focusing on compatibility with the rules, map files, and command-line play of the “Warzone” version of Risk.
Technologies Used: Utilized advanced C++ programming techniques and concepts.
Development: Worked in teams of 5 to develop different parts of the project, with each assignment building upon the code developed in the previous assignments.
Game Design: Implemented a game consisting of 5 different phases including Startup, Reinforcement, Orders Issuing, Orders Execution, and End Phase, with transitions between phases triggered by specific conditions.
Map Implementation: Created a connected graph map representing a world map, where each node is a territory and each edge represents adjacency between territories. Implemented the ability for the game to be played on any connected graph defined by the user.
Order Execution: Developed various game orders including deploy, advance, bomb, blockade, airlift, and negotiate, each having specific effects on the game.
Testing & Debugging: Ensured the accurate execution of orders and transitions between game phases, and resolved any issues encountered during the development process.
